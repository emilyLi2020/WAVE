## ✅ Blocker resolved (2026-05-16)

Issue #11 is closed. The fine-tune was re-exported via `litert-torch 0.9.0`
on a rented Threadripper box (PEFT merge → `litert_torch.generative.export_hf`
with `dynamic_wi4_afp32` quant + `externalize_embedder=True`). New bundle is
at `Maelstrome/lora-wave-session-r32/litert-lm/model.litertlm` (2.56 GB);
the old `mediapipe/model.litertlm` is preserved as-is. Magic header bytes
match the stock `litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm` exactly.

`mobile/src/runtime/model-cache.ts` already points at the new URL. **If your
device had the old 5 GB bundle cached**, the cache-hit check now requires
exact size match against `expectedBytes`, so the stale file will be discarded
and the new one downloaded on next `ensureModel('litert-wave')`.

### Original blocker writeup (kept for context)

**The LITERTLM bundle on HF was in the wrong flavor for our wrapper.**

Quick recap of how we found this:

1. Smoke screen on a physical iPhone hit `errno 2` from the LiteRT-LM C++
   engine — turned out to be a `file://` URI vs raw POSIX path mismatch
   (commit `2b6fdc6` strips the prefix before passing to `loadModel`).
2. Next iteration: file found, readable, but engine creation still fails
   ("Failed to create LiteRT-LM engine. Tried backend 'gpu' and CPU fallback").
3. Diagnosis: our `Maelstrome/lora-wave-session-r32/mediapipe/model.litertlm`
   was produced by **Google's MediaPipe Model Maker** (per its own
   [HF README](https://huggingface.co/Maelstrome/lora-wave-session-r32/blob/main/mediapipe/README.md)).
   The wrapper `react-native-litert-lm` calls `litert_lm_engine_create()` —
   a different Google runtime that won't load MediaPipe-flavored bundles
   even though they share the `.litertlm` extension and `LITERTLM` magic
   bytes. Same trap as the MediaPipe-web postmortem
   (`docs/postmortems/mediapipe-finetune.md`), one layer deeper.
4. Size check confirms: stock `litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm` is
   2.59 GB; ours is 5.07 GB. The LiteRT-LM build mmaps embedding params
   separately and runs ~half the on-disk footprint.
5. **Confirmation (2026-05-16):** stock-Gemma diagnostic button (added in
   `5288b28`) was tapped on the physical iPhone — the unmodified
   `litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm` loads through the same
   wrapper. Same device, same wrapper, only the bundle differs.

### Paths forward

| Path | Status | Cost | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Re-export via `litert-torch` Generative API | Filed as issue #11 | Needs a **Linux x86_64** box (not Mac — `litert-torch` is Linux-only) | Delegated |
| Verify the diagnosis with stock Gemma 4 | Optional sanity check | Add a "Try stock Gemma" button to the smoke screen pointing at `https://huggingface.co/litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-litert-lm/resolve/main/gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm` | Next session |
| Contingency: pivot to llama.rn + GGUF | Documented in plan, not wired | ~3-4h to wire `llamarn-generators.ts` against `Maelstrome/lora-wave-session-r32/gguf/` | If #11 stalls |

Until #11 lands, the LiteRT smoke screen is the **only** blocked test page.
Whisper STT and Kokoro TTS are independent and should run; the combined
voice loop just gates the LLM step on LiteRT.

## TL;DR — overall state

- Branch: `pivot/react-native-litert` (~14 commits, all on a clean main+1).
- Type-check is green; `npx expo-doctor` is 17/17 green.
- The user is running `npx expo start --dev-client` and successfully
  installed a dev build on a physical iPhone, after the EAS build
  (`react-native-litert-lm@0.3.6` — `0.3.7` is broken upstream, filed as
  [hung-yueh/react-native-litert-lm#9](https://github.com/hung-yueh/react-native-litert-lm/issues/9)).
- Routes structure (`app/`): dev menu home → `/tests/{litert,whisper,kokoro,combined}`
  and `/session/{intake,safety,chunk,checkin,reflection}`.
- Unified model cache (`src/runtime/model-cache.ts`) + cache panel embedded
  in the dev menu home.

### Test pages

| Route | What it does | State |
|---|---|---|
| `/tests/litert` | Download `model.litertlm` from HF → load via `react-native-litert-lm` → generate chunk 1 → Zod-validate. Memory + tok/s + TTFT panel. | Ready to test on device (#11 resolved) |
| `/tests/whisper` | Push-to-talk: record via `expo-audio` → `whisper.rn` (ggml-tiny.en on Metal GPU) → transcript + RTF. | Ready to test on device |
| `/tests/kokoro` | Text input → `react-native-sherpa-onnx` Kokoro TTS (CoreML EP, ANE) → playback. Needs `./scripts/download-kokoro.sh` to populate `assets/kokoro/`. | Ready once the bundle is downloaded |
| `/tests/combined` | Push-to-talk MVP: record → Whisper → LiteRT → Kokoro → play. State machine for the four subsystems. | Wired; depends on `/tests/litert` working |

### Production session screens

All five (`intake`, `safety`, `chunk`, `checkin`, `reflection`) exist as
navigable skeletons under `app/session/`. They link forward in the flow
but don't run the reducer yet — the reducer (`src/session/session-machine.ts`)
is ported but not wired.

## First-launch checklist

```bash
# 1. Enroll in the Apple Developer Program ($99/yr, 24-48h).
#    Required for com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit.

# 2. Install EAS CLI and log in.
npm i -g eas-cli
eas login

# 3. Register your physical iPhone 15 Pro / 16 Pro UDID.
cd mobile
eas device:create

# 4. Populate the Kokoro asset bundle (one-shot, ~330 MB).
./scripts/download-kokoro.sh

# 5. Cloud-build the iOS dev client and auto-upload to TestFlight in one go.
eas build -p ios --profile development --submit

# 6. When the TestFlight email lands, install on the iPhone.

# 7. Start the JS dev server.
npx expo start --dev-client
```

After step 7 the app should open on the dev menu home. Cache panel at the
bottom shows what's already downloaded; tap the rows to navigate to each
test page.

## Critical gotchas

- **Branch is `pivot/react-native-litert`, not `main`.** Push approval
  required.

- **`react-native-litert-lm` pinned to `0.3.6`** (not the latest `0.3.7` —
  that release is broken upstream; iOS frameworks asset was never attached
  to the GitHub release. See [hung-yueh#9](https://github.com/hung-yueh/react-native-litert-lm/issues/9)).
  If a `0.3.8` lands with the asset fix, we can move forward.

- **`app.json` bundle identifier is a placeholder** (`com.wave.mobile`).
  If your Apple team needs a specific bundle ID, change it before the
  first EAS build.

- **`legacy-peer-deps=true` is in `mobile/.npmrc`** because
  `react-native-litert-lm` declares `peerOptional expo@>=55.0.0` and
  we're on Expo 54. Keep until the wrapper drops the constraint.

- **`Don't commit `mobile/assets/kokoro/`.** Gitignored. Anyone cloning
  the repo runs `scripts/download-kokoro.sh` once to populate it (or EAS
  Build does on its first run for that build profile).

- **Memory ceiling is real.** Demo on iPhone 15/16 Pro. iPhone 14 Pro and
  earlier (6 GB RAM) likely won't fit the full stack.

- **No barge-in cancel yet.** `sendMessageAsync` in the LiteRT wrapper
  doesn't expose an AbortSignal. Future polish for the combined loop.

- **Whisper test page uses Metal GPU**, not the ANE CoreML encoder.
  Moving encoder to ANE is a follow-up that frees Metal for Gemma decode.

- **expo-file-system v19 deprecated the legacy procedural API**
  (`getInfoAsync`, `makeDirectoryAsync`, `documentDirectory`,
  `createDownloadResumable`) — they now THROW at runtime. We migrated to
  the `File`/`Directory`/`Paths` class API in `src/runtime/model-cache.ts`
  but kept `createDownloadResumable` via the `expo-file-system/legacy`
  subpath because the new `File.downloadFileAsync` has no progress
  callback in its options.

- **LiteRT-LM C++ wants raw POSIX paths**, not `file://` URIs. Stripped
  in `litert-generators.ts` `preloadWaveLiteRT()`. Don't reintroduce.

## File-by-file pointers

For "where do I add a new model?":
- Add a manifest entry to `MODELS` in `src/runtime/model-cache.ts`.
- Call `ensureModel('your-id', { onProgress })` from your code.

For "where do I change the LLM behavior?":
- Prompt builders: `src/prompts/`. They port verbatim from `client/lib/prompts/`,
  so make any change in *both* places until the web app is sunset.
- Generation logic: `src/runtime/litert-generators.ts`. Each flow has its
  own function (chunk / reflection / insights / checkin).

For "where do I add a new screen?":
- File-based route: `app/<route>.tsx` (or `app/<group>/<route>.tsx` for a
  nested stack). Render a screen component from `src/screens/`.
- Register the route in the dev menu by adding an entry to `TEST_ENTRIES`
  or `SESSION_ENTRIES` in `app/index.tsx`.

For "what's already ported and what isn't":
- See the "Directory layout" section in `docs/architecture.md`.
- Anything under `src/` that mirrors a `client/lib/...` or `client/types/...`
  path is a verbatim port.

## When things break

- **Type-check failure:** `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` from inside
  `mobile/`. The hybrid alias map in `tsconfig.json` is what keeps the
  verbatim ports working — read the "Module resolution" section of
  `docs/architecture.md` before touching it.
- **`npx expo-doctor` flags a version mismatch:** run
  `npx expo install <package>` to pull the SDK-compatible version
  (instead of plain `npm install`).
- **EAS build fails on native module compilation:** check the build log
  for the actual error. Past failures: `react-native-litert-lm@0.3.7`
  missing iOS frameworks asset (filed upstream); `_build.json` / `_logs.txt`
  artifacts EAS dumps in `mobile/` after a failed build (gitignored).
- **App opens but a test page errors on load:** check the cache panel on
  the home screen. Models may be partially downloaded (size below
  `minBytes`); clear them and retry.
- **LiteRT smoke fails with "failed to create engine":** that's the issue
  #11 blocker. Don't spend time debugging — the bundle format is wrong.
